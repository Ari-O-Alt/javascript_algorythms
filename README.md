#### Code demonstating different programming algorithms using Javascript.

### 1. FizzBuzz

### 2. Are two words anagrams?
Program that takes two strings as input and tells us if they are anagrams or not.
### 4. Find square numbers in two arrays.
A program that takes two arrays as inputs and finds out if all the values in the second array are square numbers for the values in the first array.
### 5. Find unique values in an array.
Program that finds the number of unique values in an array, using two pointers.
### 6. Is sum of two numbers in an array zero?
Program that finds if in a sorted array of numbers, there are any two that sum up to zero. 
### 7. Biggest sum of n consecutive numbers in an array?
Program that takes as input an array of numbers as its first argument and a value (n) as its second argument. Finds the biggest value of the "n" consecutive numbers in the array.
